#Feliz Jueves
this is just a stupid lil js discord userbot that checks the current day-of-the-week index and changes your status to a specified string for a specified number of days if it matches.
Add it to your autostart or create a cron job or whatever and you're good to go.
##Settings
The Settings should be pretty self explanatory. Guides on getting your user token can be found online.
