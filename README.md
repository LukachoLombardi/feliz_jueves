# Feliz Jueves

Feliz Jueves a discord user-bot that allows you to set different discord status messages for each day of the week.

the actual functioning script is found under /FelizJueves/FelizCheck/FelizForever.js. The rest is part of an unfinished
UI for settings and autostart creation.

## **DISCLAIMER**
Discord's stance on self-bots being used like this is a bit unclear. You'll most probably be fine, even *if* it isn't technically allowed. But please note that ***I do not
take any responsibility whatsoever for any lost or banned accounts. Use at your own risk.***

## Settings
The Settings should be pretty self-explanatory. Guides on getting your user token can be found online. 
Just extract it and put it into a "token.txt" in the script directory.

You can define new status rules in the array like this. Note that the day count starts with sunday at index 0. 
daysForward simply tells the script how long to keep the status active.


```
{"statusOptions": [
        {"status": "feliz jueves!",
        "statusEmoji": "ðŸŽ‰"},
        {"status": "it's thurday, sparkle off!",
        "statusEmoji": "ðŸ¤¨"}],
    "day": 4,
    "daysForward": 1}
```

## How to build (very hacky rn)
1. get the newest web2exe binary for your platform (deprecated but whatever).
2. create two uncompressed nw.js apps using web2exe. Use the included web2exe config jsons.
    - one for FelizJueves (the configurator)
    - one for FelizCheck (the actual program)
3. rename the nw executables and folders accordingly
4. move the contents of the app.nw folder of FelizCheck into FelizCheck's root folder/where nw loads loose files from (check the [nw.js github](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps) for platform specific infos)
5. If not already happened, delete the source of the FelizCheck folder from the FelizJueves build. Put the FelizCheck app folder into FelizJueve's corresponding load folder (most likely the app.nw folder. As said, check the wiki for more infos!).
6. You're done! Run your renamed FelizJueves nw executable or repeat for other platforms.

I'll probably create an automated process for this in the future, but right now I just want to get the first release out there.
